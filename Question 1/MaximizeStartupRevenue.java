// Maximizing Tech Startup Revenue before Acquisition
// A tech startup, AlgoStart, is planning to get acquired by a larger company. To negotiate a higher
// acquisition price, AlgoStart wants to increase its revenue by launching a few high-return projects.
// However, due to limited resources, the startup can only work on at most k distinct projects before the
// acquisition.
// You are given n potential projects, where the i-th project has a projected revenue gain of revenues[i]
// and requires a minimum investment capital of investments[i] to launch.
// Initially, AlgoStart has c capital. When a project is completed, its revenue gain is added to the
// startupâ€™s total capital, which can then be reinvested into other projects.
// Your task is to determine the maximum possible capital AlgoStart can accumulate after completing at
// most k projects.
// Example 1:
// k = 2, c = 0, revenues = [2, 5, 8], investments = [0, 2, 3]
// Output: 7
// Explanation:
// ï‚· With initial capital 0, the startup can only launch Project 0 (since it requires 0 investment).
// ï‚· After completing Project 0, the capital becomes 0 + 2 = 2.
// ï‚· Now, with 2 capital, the startup can choose either Project 1 (investment 2, revenue 5) or
// Project 2 (investment 3, revenue 8).
// ï‚· To maximize revenue, it should select Project 2. However, Project 2 requires 3 capital, which is
// not available. So it selects Project 1.
// ï‚· After completing Project 1, the capital becomes 2 + 5 = 7.
// ï‚· The final maximized capital is 7.
// Example 2:
// Input:
// k = 3, c = 1, revenues = [3, 6, 10], investments = [1, 3, 5]
// Output: 19
// Explanation:
// ï‚· Initially, with 1 capital, Project 0 can be launched (investment 1, revenue 3).
// ï‚· Capital after Project 0 = 1 + 3 = 4.
// ï‚· With 4 capital, the startup can now launch Project 1 (investment 3, revenue 6).
// ï‚· Capital after Project 1 = 4 + 6 = 10.
// ï‚· Now, with 10 capital, Project 2 (investment 5, revenue 10) can be launched.
// ï‚· Final capital = 10 + 10 = 20.







//STEPS FOR SOLVING THIS SOLUTION:

// Move all projects from minInvestHeap to maxRevenueHeap where investment â‰¤ currentCapital

// Pick the top project from maxRevenueHeap (highest revenue)

// Add its revenue to capital

// Repeat for up to k rounds
